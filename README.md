We used the Vuforia extension to connect the Unity3D project to images of the bills to be detected as surfaces. We obtained 3D models of 
the monuments used as examples for this concept. We added cards of information tagged with the model to learn about the following 
monuments.

Using AR We used Unity3D to manipulate 3D models of the monuments and attraction in the near by city of The District of Columbia. The 3D 
model is shown, along with information about the monument, when the following surfaces are shown. 
One dollar bill: The Washington Monument
